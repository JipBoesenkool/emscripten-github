# How-to
1. Run workflow: "Emscripten" passing the application to build. e.g. "MyApp"
2. github auto updates based on the branch?
3. access the website on https://jipboesenkool.github.io/emscripten-github/

# TODO
- Clean up CMake scripts
  - fetch into cmake/libs
  - project pipeline into cmake/project
- Setup the other platforms because we can test them for free on this public repo
