# How-to
1. Run workflow: "Emscripten" passing the application to build. e.g. "TemplateApp"
2. github pages auto updates based on the branch
3. access the website on https://jipboesenkool.github.io/emscripten-github/

# TODO
- exclude platform from main script, make them functions
- Setup the other platforms because we can test them for free on this public repo
