github workflow
==============
A project template for SDL-based programs targeting several platforms:
* Windows [done]
* Linux [done]
* macOS [done]
* Emscripten [TODO]

# TODO
- Support emscripten and launch page on github pages
- make libs artefacts so we don't keep rebuilding them
- split scripts per platform for manual trigger
- disable mac unless release
